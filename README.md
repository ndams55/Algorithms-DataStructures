In this repository, I'm implementing various types of algorithms and data structures; Inspired by the MIT OpenOnline courses which is an introductory course covering elementary data structures (dynamic arrays, heaps, balanced binary search trees, hash tables) and algorithmic approaches to solve classical problems (sorting, graph searching, dynamic programming). Introduction to mathematical modelling of computational problems, as well as common algorithms, algorithmic paradigms, and data structures used to solve these problems. Emphasizes the relationship between algorithms and programming, and introduces basic performance measures and analysis techniques for these problems.
Adding to the skills I learned from the courses, I'm sharing with you some solutions from my daily exercises on coding platforms including [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/); and joining others surprises. Stay tuned!

<!---
If you're practising on the coding platforms mentioned above, also if you want to contribute those then you can add the questions in this repository.
